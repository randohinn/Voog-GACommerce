This is a snippet of JS code, that allows to view Voog E-commerce purchases in Google Analytics. It supports Google Tag Manager and standalone Google Analytics

## Setup

1. Set up Google Analytics on your site.
2. Enable E-commerce in your Google Analytics settings. The code does currently not support the enhanced version
3. Include the appropriate JS file.
    ## Stand-alone Google Analytics
    
    1. Download `voog-gacommerce-standalone.js` and upload it to your scripts folder in the Voog code editor.
    2. In `Settings` -> `Site`, add the following snippet inside the already present Google Analytics script tag under External stats, after `ga('send', 'pageview');`. This makes sure the snippet loads **after** Google Analytics is ready.

        ```js
        var s = document.createElement( 'script' );
        s.setAttribute( 'src', '/javascripts/voog-gacommerce-standalone.js' );
        document.body.appendChild(s);
        ```
    ## Google Tag Manager

    1. Create a Universal Analytics tag and set the Track Type to Transaction.
    2. Configure your tag with the required fields.
    3. Set your trigger as a `Custom Event` with the name of `voog-gacommerce-send`. This is critical.
    4. Publish the tag.
    5. Download `voog-gacommerce-tagmanager.js` and upload it to your scripts folder in the Voog code editor.
    6. Include this file in `Settings` -> `Site`, in the part that inserts content before the `</body>` tag.
        ```js
        <script src="/javascripts/voog-gacommerce-tagmanager.js"></script>
        ```
**Note: This does not send you the SKU's that your store has defined. All SKU's show up as "Store Product" Voog does not let you access these via the shopping cart.**
